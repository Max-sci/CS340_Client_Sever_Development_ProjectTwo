# CS340_Client_Sever_Development_ProjectTwo
Final dashboard code and README file from Project Two

Throughout this course, I learned a lot about writing code thatâ€™s easy to maintain, read, and adapt over time. One of the biggest takeaways for me was the importance of modular design and keeping code organized. A good example of this was the CRUD Python module I built in Project One. By putting all the create, read, update, and delete operations into their own separate module, the rest of the project stayed much cleaner. When I got to Project Two, it made connecting the dashboard widgets to the MongoDB database a lot easier. If I ever needed to change something in the database, like updating field names or adding a new collection, I could do it in one place without breaking everything else. Working this way also makes future projects simpler, since I could reuse that same CRUD module in other applications such as inventory systems, user data tools, or dashboards that display live data.
When I approach problems as a computer scientist, I try to break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces and focus on what the client actually needs. For the Grazioso Salvare project, that meant figuring out how to store and display animal rescue data in a useful way. I started by designing the database structure, then built a dashboard that could pull data from it, filter it, and show it in an easy-to-understand format. This project was more complex than some of my earlier assignments because it involved thinking about how the data connected, how users would interact with the dashboard, and how everything needed to flow together. Going forward, I plan to keep using this kind of process by starting with the requirements, building in modules, and testing as I go. This way I create solid and scalable databases that fit what clients are looking for.
There is more than just writing code to this job. One has to build solutions that help organizations make sense of information and make better decisions. The Grazioso Salvare dashboard project really showed me how much of an impact that kind of work can have. By giving the company a way to easily visualize animal data and spot trends, they can make quicker and more informed choices when it comes to rescues and training. Projects like this show why computer science matters: it bridges technology and real-world problems, helping companies work smarter and reach their goals more effectively.
